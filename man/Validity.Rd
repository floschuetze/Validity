\title{Test for the Validity of Regression Models}
\usage{
validity(y, X, reg, v = 0, s = 0, l = 0, r = 0, N = 1000, text = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Dependent variable, vector of (nx1)}

\item{X}{Regressors, can be either a vector (nx1) or a matrix (nxm) if there is more than one regressor}

\item{reg}{(optional, default is OLS) It is possible to define your own regression function. The output of the function must be the fitted values. The input must be the dependent variable and the independent variables. See the function "reg" in the readme file as an example.}

\item{v}{(optional, default is v = 0) Either 0 or 1. v = 0: Validity-Test from Frahm, G., 2023, A Test for the Validity of Regression Models. Available on SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4610329

v = 1: Test from Stute,W., 1997, Nonparametric model checks for regression. The Annals of Statistics 25, pp. 613 to 641.}

\item{s}{(optional, default is s = 0) Either 0 or 1. s = 0: Cramer-von-Mises; s = 1: Kolmogorov-Smirnov; This does only matter for v = 1}

\item{l}{(optional, default is l = 0) Controls how much weight is given to the left side of [0,1] of the beta distribution}

\item{r}{(optional, default is r = 0) Controls how much weight is given to the right side of [0,1] of the beta distribution}

\item{N}{(optional, default is N = 1000) The number of bootstrap replicates. Code may run faster if N<1000}

\item{text}{(optional, default is text = 1) Either 0 or 1. If 0, output text is suppressed}
}
\value{
The function returns the hypothesis to be tested. The t-value and p-value are also returned
}
\description{
validity tests if a regression is valid. An own regression can be specified for this purpose, otherwise OLS is the default option. The function returns the corresponding p-value and t-value.
}
\details{
The "validity" function represents the fundamental component of the package. It performs a statistical test with the objective of determining the validity of a regression model that requires a dependent variable, which is represented as a vector of length "n". Additionally, it requires the regressors, which could be a vector or a matrix of length "m*n". By default, an OLS regression is run using a constant and all regressors to explain y.
}
\examples{
It is evident that the model "y=constant+beta*x" is valid.
x <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
y <- 10*x
validity(y,x)

It is evident that the model "y=constant+beta*x" is not valid.
x <- rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=1)
y <- x^3-x^2
validity(y,x)
